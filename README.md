# Pandas_Challenge_PyCitySchools

## Requirements & Summary
This assignment required Jupyter Notebook. The PyCitySchools.ipynb file must be opened in a Jupyter notebook and each cell must be run in order from the top down for the code to run the way it was intended.

## Background
For this challenge, we were asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We were given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. We then aggregated the data to showcase trends in school performance.
The final report includes each of the following:

**District Summary**

This is a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:
- Total Schools
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


**School Summary**

This is an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


**Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)**

This is a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.
