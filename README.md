# Pandas_Challenge_PyCitySchools

## Requirements

This assignment required me to download and use Jupyter Notebook for the first time. The PyCitySchools.ipynb file must be opened in a Jupyter notebook and each cell must be run in order from the top down for the code to run the way it was intended.

This challenge gave me a great introduction to dataframes and merging and cleaning data to get a desired outcome. There were certainly struggles with the different elements such as the 'groupby' and 'index' functions as well as the conditional statements and binning function. Through perseverance and google searches, I was able to get all the dataframes to output the desired information.

The analysis for this challenge gave me a feeling of real-life application and what I might be able to expect for future jobs. Being able to find data is one thing but being able to read and analyze the data and report to an end user is another aspect that was important to see.

## Background

For this challenge, we were asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We were given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. We then aggregated the data to showcase trends in school performance.
The final report includes each of the following:

**District Summary**

This is a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:
- Total Schools
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


**School Summary**

This is an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
- School Name
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total School Budget
- Per Student Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


**Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)**

This is a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.


**Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)**

This is a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing.


**Math Scores by Grade**

This is a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level at each school.


**Reading Scores by Grade**

This is a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level at each school.


**Scores by School Spending**

This is a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student).
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


**Scores by School Size**
 
This is a table that breaks down school performances based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

**Scores by School Type**

This is a table that breaks down school performances based on school type (Charter vs. District).
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
- % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
- % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
