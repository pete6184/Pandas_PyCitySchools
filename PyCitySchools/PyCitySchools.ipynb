    "# Trend Analysis\n",

    "## Trend #1 \n",
    "* District schools (which all had enrolment over 2500 students) reported much lower percentage of students passing math than those of the charter schools (which all had enrolment under 2500 students). District schools only reported ~66% of their students passing math versus over 90% of the students in the charter schools. \n",
    "* The percentage of students passing reading were a little closer between the two school types with district schools having ~80% of the students passing versus over 95% of all charter students passing reading.\n",
    "* The overall number of students passing both math and reading were also vastly different between the different school types. District schools only have ~50% of their students passing both reading and math where are charter schools report ~90% of student passing both subjects.\n",
    "* Another interesting bit of information is that the average scores for math (Charter 83.47 vs District 76.96) and reading (Charter 83.9 vs 80.97) are much more similar between the two school types, whereas the percentages of students passing were drastically different. This tells us that within district schools there is a large disparity in students and how well they are performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trend #2\n",
    "* Another interesting trend that I noticed was that schools that spend less money per student performed much better than the school who spent more. The schools spending < 585 dollars per student (lowest bin) had the highest number of students passing each (and both) subjects (90\\%) whereas the schools spending between 645- 680 dollars (highest bin) had the least number of students passing.\n",
    "* I would have expected that to be opposite of what we found out."
